    "### Toxic Comment Classification Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This code defines a Kubeflow pipeline for toxic comment classification using BERT. The pipeline performs data downloading, tokenization, encoding, and model training, leveraging Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and Vertex AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download Data Component**:\n",
    "   - Downloads a CSV dataset from GCS and saves it locally in the pipeline‚Äôs storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tokenize and Encode Component**:\n",
    "   - Tokenizes and encodes comments using a specified BERT tokenizer.\n",
    "   - Prepares inputs for model training by generating `input_ids`, `attention_masks`, and `labels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Training Component**:\n",
    "   - Trains a BERT-based model using the tokenized data for multi-label classification of toxic comments.\n",
    "   - Uses AdamW optimizer and a learning rate scheduler.\n",
    "   - Saves the trained model to the pipeline's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pipeline Definition**:\n",
    "   - Defines the sequence of steps in the `toxic_comment_classification_pipeline`.\n",
    "   - Combines all components, ensuring smooth data flow from one step to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pipeline Compilation and Execution**:\n",
    "   - Compiles the pipeline into a JSON format (`encode_train_pipeline.json`) for submission.\n",
    "   - Initializes and runs the pipeline job on Vertex AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes: \n",
    ">- Ensure `PROJECT_ID`, `BUCKET_NAME`, `PIPELINE_ROOT`, and `SERVICE_ACCOUNT` are set to valid values.\n",
    ">- GPU acceleration can be requested in the training component (adjusted based on region availability).\n",
    ">- Please Access GPU before running this below cell. You can follow the steps mention in start of file \n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline is modular and can be extended with additional components, such as data evaluation or hyperparameter tuning.\n",
