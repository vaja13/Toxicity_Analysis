    "     docker build -t gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/PROJECT_NAME:latest .\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "### Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy the Model on Google Cloud Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up the Python Environment**:\n",
    "   - Create a project directory named `toxic_comment_app`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Open the Project in VS Code**:\n",
    "   - Open the `toxic_comment_app` folder in Visual Studio Code to manage and edit the files conveniently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional for Local Testing)**:\n",
    "   - Open the terminal in VS Code and run the following command to set up a Python virtual environment:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python -m venv myenv\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This step is optional and primarily for local testing to ensure all code functions are handled properly before deploying.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deployment on Google Cloud**:\n",
    "   - Instead of deploying this local environment to Google Cloud, we’ll create a Docker image that includes all the necessary dependencies for the app.\n",
    "   - The Docker image will handle all required libraries and versions, ensuring consistency across environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: The local environment setup is just for testing purposes. For deployment, the Docker image will handle all requirements, so there’s no need to push the local setup to Google Cloud.\n",

    "### Set Up Dependencies for the App\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a `requirements.txt` File**:\n",
    "   - List all necessary libraries in a `requirements.txt` file to streamline dependency management:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     flask\n",
    "     transformers\n",
    "     torch\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Dependencies**:\n",
    "   - Open the terminal, ensure your virtual environment is activated, and install all dependencies with:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "3. **Library Overview**:\n",
    "   - **Transformers**: Provides tokenizers and model configurations for handling the fine-tuned BERT model saved on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\n",
    "   - **Torch**: Used for model inference, enabling the execution of the pre-trained model.\n",
    "   - **Flask**: Manages HTTP POST requests from users and returns responses in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Next Step**:\n",
    "   - We will download the fine-tuned model saved on GCP and create a directory in the local setup to store it.\n",
