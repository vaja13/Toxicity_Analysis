# 🚀 **Complete Workflow Pipeline for GCP Deployment & Model Training Using Kubeflow Pipelines**  

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project provides a **complete workflow pipeline** for deploying and training a machine learning model on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** using **Kubeflow Pipelines**. The entire process is detailed in the **Jupyter Notebook(code.ipynb)**, serving as a guided walkthrough for setting up, training, and deploying models efficiently on the cloud.  

## 🔍 **Key Features**  
- **GCP Setup Guide** – Instructions for account setup, billing configuration, and project initialization.  
- **Kubeflow Pipeline Implementation** – A step-by-step breakdown of building and executing **Kubeflow Pipelines** for model training and deployment.  
- **End-to-End Machine Learning Workflow** – Covers **data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and deployment** on GCP.  
- **Integration with Cloud Services** – Utilizes **Cloud Storage, Vertex AI, and Kubernetes Engine** to streamline the ML pipeline.  

## 🏗️ **Workflow Pipeline Breakdown**  
1️⃣ **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Setup**  
   - Creating a **GCP account** and enabling necessary services.  
   - Setting up a **billing account** and configuring IAM roles.  

2️⃣ **Kubeflow Pipelines Configuration**  
   - Installing **Kubeflow Pipelines**.  
   - Setting up pipeline components, including data ingestion, transformation, and model training.  

3️⃣ **Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Training a machine learning model using **PyTorch**.  
  

4️⃣ **Model Evaluation & Deployment**  
   - Evaluating model performance using **metrics and validation techniques**.  
   - Deploying the trained model using **Vertex AI** and **Kubeflow Serving**.  

5️⃣ **Automating the Workflow with Kubeflow Pipelines**  
   - Creating pipeline components using **Python SDK**.  
   - Executing end-to-end **MLOps workflow automation**.  

## ⚙️ **Setup & Execution**
